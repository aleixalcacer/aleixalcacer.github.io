They are a measure of how well a model fits the observed data. By maximizing the likelihood of the model, it is possible to improve the model’s accuracy and make better predictions.\nIn the article, log-likelihood functions will be used as error functions in the defined models. This means that the models will be trained to minimize the negative log-likelihood of their predictions, which will improve their accuracy. The Normal, Bernoulli, and Poisson log-likelihood functions will be used in this case, which are appropriate for models that make predictions using normal, binary, and count data, respectively.\n\nNormal distribution\nThe normal log-likelihood function is used to calculate the log-likelihood of a normal distribution given a set of data. The formula for the normal log-likelihood function is as follows:\n\\[log(L) = -\\frac{n}{2} log(2 \\pi) - \\frac{n}{2} log(\\sigma^2) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(x_i - \\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}\\]\nwhere \\(L\\) is the likelihood function, \\(n\\) is the number of data points, \\(x_i\\) is the \\(i\\)-th data point, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the data, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the data, and the summation is over all data points in the sample.\n\n\nBernoulli distribution\nThe Bernoulli log-likelihood function is used to calculate the log-likelihood of a Bernoulli distribution given a set of data. The formula for the Bernoulli log-likelihood function is as follows:\n\\[log(L) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} [y_i \\cdot log(p) + (1 - y_i) \\cdot log(1 - p)]\\]\nwhere \\(L\\) is the likelihood function, \\(y_i\\) is the outcome of the binary event (1 if the event happened, 0 if it did not), \\(p\\) is the probability of the event happening, and the summation is over all events in the data.\n\n\nPoisson distribution\nFinally, the Poisson log-likelihood function is used to calculate the log-likelihood of a Poisson distribution given a set of data. The formula for the Poisson log-likelihood function is as follows:\n\\[log(L) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} [n_i \\cdot log(\\lambda) - \\lambda - log(n_i!)]\\]\nwhere \\(L\\) is the likelihood function, \\(n_i\\) is the number of events observed in the \\(i\\)-th group, \\(\\lambda\\) is the rate parameter of the Poisson distribution, and the summation is over all groups in the data."

    "text": "Stochastic Block Model\nThe Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is a popular model used to generate synthetic networks with community structure. In an SBM, the nodes in the network are divided into groups or “blocks”, and the connections between nodes are determined by the blocks they belong to. The SBM is often used to test the performance of community detection algorithms, which are algorithms that aim to identify the groups or communities present in a network.\nFor bipartite networks, the SBM can be viewed as a matrix factorization problem where the adjacency matrix (which represents the connections between the nodes) is decomposed into three matrices, one representing the blocks and the others representing the connections between the blocks. More specifically, let \\(X\\) be the adjacency matrix of a network with \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) nodes respectively, where \\(A_{ij}\\) is the number of connections between nodes \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). In the SBM, this adjacency matrix can be written as the product of three matrices, \\(A\\), \\(Z\\) and \\(C\\), where \\(A\\) is a \\(M\\times K\\) matrix, \\(Z\\) is a \\(K\\times L\\) matrix and \\(D\\) is a \\(L\\times N\\) matrix:\n\\[X \\approx AZD\\]\nHere, \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) are the matrices that represents the blocks, where \\(A_{ik}\\) is the membership of node \\(i\\) in block \\(k\\) and \\(D_{lj}\\) is the membership of node \\(j\\) in block \\(l\\). \\(Z\\) is the matrix that represents the connections between the blocks, where \\(Z_{kl}\\) is the probability of a connection between nodes in block \\(k\\) and block \\(l\\).\nThe matrix factorization of the adjacency matrix in the SBM allows us to model the community structure of the network by defining the blocks and the connections between the blocks. The blocks can be thought of as the groups or communities in the network, and the connections between the blocks can be used to control the strength and structure of the communities. For example, if \\(Z_{kl}\\) is high, it indicates that there are many connections between nodes in block \\(k\\) and block \\(l\\), and the corresponding communities are likely to be strongly connected. On the other hand, if \\(Z_{kl}\\) is low, it indicates that there are few connections between nodes in block \\(k\\) and block \\(l\\), and the corresponding communities are likely to be weakly connected.\nIn summary, the Stochastic Block Model is a popular model for generating synthetic networks with community structure, and it can be viewed as a matrix factorization problem where the adjacency matrix of the network is decomposed into three matrices representing the blocks and the connections between the blocks.\nReferences: .\n# $$X_{MN} \\sim A_{MK} Z_{KL} D_{LN}$$"

    "text": "Degree correction\nA degree corrected algorithm is a variant of an existing algorithm that has been modified to account for the fact that the nodes in a network may have different degrees (i.e., different numbers of connections to other nodes). In many networks, the nodes have varying degrees, and a standard algorithm may not perform well when applied to such a network because it may give more weight to nodes with higher degrees, leading to biased or inaccurate results. A degree corrected algorithm addresses this issue by taking into account the degrees of the nodes when calculating the algorithm’s result.\nFor example, when applying a community detection algorithm to a network generated using the SBM, it is important to take into account the degree distribution of the nodes in the network. The degree distribution of a network is the distribution of the number of connections (or “edges”) that each node has to other nodes in the network. In a network generated using the SBM, the degree distribution of the nodes will be different depending on the blocks they belong to. For example, nodes in the same block will tend to have similar degrees, while nodes in different blocks will have different degrees.\nIf a standard community detection algorithm is applied to a network generated using the SBM, it may not perform well because it may give more weight to nodes with higher degrees, leading to biased or inaccurate results. A degree corrected version of the algorithm, on the other hand, would take into account the degree distribution of the nodes and give less weight to nodes with higher degrees, resulting in more accurate community detection."
