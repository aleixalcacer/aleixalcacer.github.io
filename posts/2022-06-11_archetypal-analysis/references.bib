   abstract = {Archetypal analysis represents a set of observations as convex combinations of pure patterns, or archetypes. The original geometric formulation of finding archetypes by approximating the convex hull of the observations assumes them to be real–valued. This, unfortunately, is not compatible with many practical situations. In this paper we revisit archetypal analysis from the basic principles, and propose a probabilistic framework that accommodates other observation types such as integers, binary, and probability vectors. We corroborate the proposed methodology with convincing real-world applications on finding archetypal soccer players based on performance data, archetypal winter tourists based on binary survey data, archetypal disaster-affected countries based on disaster count data, and document archetypes based on term-frequency data. We also present an appropriate visualization tool to summarize archetypal analysis solution better.},

   abstract = {Archetypal analysis represents each individual in a data set as a mixture of individuals of pure type or archetypes. The archetypes themselves are restricted to being mixtures of the individuals in the data set. Archetypes are selected by minimizing the squared error in representing each individual as a mixture of archetypes. The usefulness of archetypal analysis is illustrated on several data sets. Computing the archetypes is a nonlinear least squares problem, which is solved using an alternating minimizing algorithm. © 1994 American Statistical Association and the Amencan Society for Quality Control.},

   abstract = {Archetypal analysis (AA) proposed by Cutler and Breiman (1994) [7] estimates the principal convex hull (pch) of a data set. As such aa favors features that constitute representative 'corners' of the data, i.e., distinct aspects or archetypes. We currently show that aa enjoys the interpretability of clustering - without being limited to hard assignment and the uniqueness of svd - without being limited to orthogonal representations. In order to do large scale aa, we derive an efficient algorithm based on projected gradient as well as an initialization procedure we denote F. urthestS. um that is inspired by the F. urthestF. irst approach widely used for k-means (Hochbaum and Shmoys, 1985 [14]). We generalize the aa procedure to kernel- aa in order to extract the principal convex hull in potential infinite Hilbert spaces and derive a relaxation of aa when the archetypes cannot be represented as convex combinations of the observed data. We further demonstrate that the aa model is relevant for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction for a large variety of machine learning problems taken from computer vision, neuroimaging, chemistry, text mining and collaborative filtering leading to highly interpretable representations of the dynamics in the data. Matlab code for the derived algorithms is available for download from www.mortenmorup.dk. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},
