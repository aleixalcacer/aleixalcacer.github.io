abstract: |
  In the realm of higher education, traditional lecture-based approaches have faced challenges from innovative teaching methodologies such as the flipped classroom [@bishop2013flipped]. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of the flipped classroom model in enhancing class attendance and final grades among undergraduate students enrolled in the course Statistics Applied to Public Management and Administration. Employing a quasi-experimental design, two groups of students were examined: the previous year's group experienced a lecture-based format, while the current year's group participated in a flipped classroom intervention specifically designed for this course. Data on class attendance and final grades were collected and compared between the two groups.

  The findings revealed a substantial increase in class attendance rates within the flipped-based classes group compared to the lecture-based classes group of the previous year. Furthermore, students in the flipped-based classes group demonstrated notable improvements in their final grades in comparison to their counterparts in the previous year's lecture-based classes group. These results highlight the potential efficacy of the flipped classroom model when applied to the course Statistics Applied to Public Management and Administration in fostering student engagement and academic performance. Implications for educators are discussed, and suggestions for further research are provided.
